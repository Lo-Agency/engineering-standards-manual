# Engineering Standards Manual
Version: 0.1

Last modified: Dec 2, 2023

## Introduction
Welcome to the Software Development & Technology Handbook for our engineering team. The purpose of this handbook is to outline the standards, policies, processes, and guidelines followed across all software projects in our organization.

Having clear, well-documented development practices is essential for building high-quality products efficiently at scale. This handbook establishes these common methodologies for our technology teams to promote consistency and best practices in our approach to software engineering.

The contents covered in this guide include:

- Technology Stack Overviews: Approved languages, frameworks, databases, and other technologies organized by project type
- Application Development Standards: Coding conventions, code quality processes, documentation requirements, and architecture guidelines
- Engineering Team Policies: Issue tracking protocols, code review procedures, build & testing rules, and other operational standards
- Technical Best Practices: Security, performance, modularity and other coding best practices for efficient, sustainable software
- Development Processes & Tools: Step-by-step implementation guidelines for our software development life cycle, version control system, CI/CD tools, and other key platforms

This handbook is intended to codify the practices we employ to deliver secure, scalable, and reliable products. It defines what technologies to use when, how to write high-quality code at scale, what procedures to follow during development, and overarching best practices to work efficiently as a team.

Adhering to these documented standards will enable us to collaborate smoothly, maintain cleaner systems long-term, improve consistency across our engineering division. We look forward to collaborating successfully on impactful projects using the guidelines contained in this handbook.

Please direct any questions or comments to [hi@lo.agency](mailto:hi@lo.agency) as we continue improving our practices. Thank you in advance for following these methodologies in your valuable work!

Here is an outline of the technology stacks for our different project types:

    - Same as Web Applications

Here is an expanded draft of the Application Development Standards section:

## Application Development Standards

### Coding Conventions

We follow consistent conventions to enhance code clarity and readability across all projects:

#### Pascal Case Naming 

All variables, functions, files, components, folders etc. should use **PascalCase**. This capitalizes the first letter of each word (e.g. `AppComponent`, `GetCustomers()`).

Using PascalCase improves scanability of code and keeps file/folder names readable.

#### Atomic Design

We structure our React and React Native applications using the **Atomic Design** methodology. This divides components into atoms (basic building blocks), molecules (combing atoms), organisms (combining molecules), templates, and pages.

Organizing code this way keeps components and features modular, reusable, and easier to maintain.

### Code Quality Processes

To guarantee excellent code quality, all pull requests must go through peer **code reviews** before being merged, regardless of the experience level of the engineer. 

Code reviews enable knowledge sharing, better architectural patterns, and error catching before changes impact other developers.

For more complex features, we also utilize **pair programming** - two developers coding together at one workstation. This enables real-time feedback and faster solutions to problems.

### Documentation Requirements

We emphasize writing clean, self-documenting code using best practices and semantic naming. However, additional documentation is required in certain cases:

#### Complex Functions/Components

Any highly complex logic should include inline comments explaining the intention and conceptual flow to aid future maintainers.

#### Project README

All projects must include a thorough README file covering:

- Local development environment setup
- Description of technologies/services used
- Deployment instructions
- Configuration of any API keys, environment variables, etc.

The goal is to enable anyone to smoothly install, run, and deploy the software by following the outlined steps.


## Engineering Team Policies

### Issue Tracking Protocols 

We standardize issue/task tracking in Linear using preset templates. Here are two example of them:

- **üêõ Bug Reports** - For software defects
- **üèñÔ∏è New Features** - For enhancement requests 

Engineers can self-assign tasks or add them to the backlog for later prioritization. We assign issues collaboratively during daily/weekly syncs.

*For a detailed overview of our entire task management process, please refer to the Task Management Guidelines section.*

Having centralized issue tracking maintains visibility and aligns priorities across teams.

Here is a draft of the Engineering Team Policies section:

### Code Review Procedures

The code review process for pull requests (PRs) is:

1. Engineer submits PR when task complete 
2. Engineer adds 1+ teammates as reviewers
3. Teammates review code changes within a few hours
4. Once approved, engineer merges PR
5. If waiting on reviews, engineer switches to another task

Reviews ensure changes meet standards before impacting other developers.

### Testing Rules 

Testing boosts our code coverage and regression testing:

- Unit testing with Jest is mandatory for web applications
- Additional plugins used for improved testing ergonomics 
- Website testing is encouraged but not required 
- Aim for test coverage between 70-90%


## Technical Best Practices 

### Security

We actively maintain secure development standards including:

- Encryption of sensitive data
- Input validation and sanitization 
- Use of content security policies  
- Regular dependency audits
- Static analysis testing
- Confidential data handling procedures

*This section will expand as new applicable standards emerge.*

### Performance

Common web performance metrics we optimize for:

- Page Load Time
- First Contentful Paint 
- Time to Interactive
- First Meaningful Paint
- Speed Index
- Time to First Byte
- Render Blocking Resources
- Network Requests 
- File Size/Compression
- Mobile Performance

We continually evaluate and enhance performance using Lighthouse audits, performance budgets, and tree shaking unused code.

*This section will expand as new applicable standards emerge.*

### Modularity

To maintain legible and maintainable code: 

- Components are kept small and single-purpose
- Strict separation of concerns is followed
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles applied
- Loose coupling between modules
- High cohesion inside modules

This enhances readability, reusability and reduces bugs.
