# Engineering Team Policies

## Issue Tracking Protocols 

We standardize issue/task tracking in Linear using preset templates. Here are two example of them:

- **🐛 Bug Reports** - For software defects
- **🏖️ New Features** - For enhancement requests 

Engineers can self-assign tasks or add them to the backlog for later prioritization. We assign issues collaboratively during daily/weekly syncs.

*For a detailed overview of our entire task management process, please refer to the Task Management Guidelines section.*

Having centralized issue tracking maintains visibility and aligns priorities across teams.

## Code Review Procedures

The code review process for pull requests (PRs) is:

1. Engineer submits PR when task complete 
2. Engineer adds 1+ teammates as reviewers
3. Teammates review code changes within a few hours
4. Once approved, engineer merges PR
5. If waiting on reviews, engineer switches to another task

Reviews ensure changes meet standards before impacting other developers.

## Testing Rules 

Testing boosts our code coverage and regression testing:

- Unit testing with Jest is mandatory for web applications
- Additional plugins used for improved testing ergonomics 
- Website testing is encouraged but not required 
- Aim for test coverage between 70-90%
