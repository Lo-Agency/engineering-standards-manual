# Introduction

Welcome to the Software Development & Technology Handbook for our engineering team. The purpose of this handbook is to outline the standards, policies, processes, and guidelines followed across all software projects in our organization.

Having clear, well-documented development practices is essential for building high-quality products efficiently at scale. This handbook establishes these common methodologies for our technology teams to promote consistency and best practices in our approach to software engineering.

The contents covered in this guide include:

- Technology Stack Overviews: Approved languages, frameworks, databases, and other technologies organized by project type
- Application Development Standards: Coding conventions, code quality processes, documentation requirements, and architecture guidelines
- Engineering Team Policies: Issue tracking protocols, code review procedures, build & testing rules, and other operational standards
- Technical Best Practices: Security, performance, modularity and other coding best practices for efficient, sustainable software
- Development Processes & Tools: Step-by-step implementation guidelines for our software development life cycle, version control system, CI/CD tools, and other key platforms

This handbook is intended to codify the practices we employ to deliver secure, scalable, and reliable products. It defines what technologies to use when, how to write high-quality code at scale, what procedures to follow during development, and overarching best practices to work efficiently as a team.

Adhering to these documented standards will enable us to collaborate smoothly, maintain cleaner systems long-term, improve consistency across our engineering division. We look forward to collaborating successfully on impactful projects using the guidelines contained in this handbook.
