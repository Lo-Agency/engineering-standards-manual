# Technical Best Practices 

## Security

We actively maintain secure development standards including:

- Encryption of sensitive data
- Input validation and sanitization 
- Use of content security policies  
- Regular dependency audits
- Static analysis testing
- Confidential data handling procedures

*This section will expand as new applicable standards emerge.*

## Performance

Common web performance metrics we optimize for:

- Page Load Time
- First Contentful Paint 
- Time to Interactive
- First Meaningful Paint
- Speed Index
- Time to First Byte
- Render Blocking Resources
- Network Requests 
- File Size/Compression
- Mobile Performance

We continually evaluate and enhance performance using Lighthouse audits, performance budgets, and tree shaking unused code.

## Modularity

To maintain legible and maintainable code: 

- Components are kept small and single-purpose
- Strict separation of concerns is followed
- DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles applied
- Loose coupling between modules
- High cohesion inside modules

This enhances readability, reusability and reduces bugs.
